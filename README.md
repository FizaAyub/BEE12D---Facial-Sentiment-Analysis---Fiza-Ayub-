# BEE12D-- Facial Sentiment Analysis ---Fiza-Ayub-
The project comprises several interconnected modules for developing a Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Initially, diverse facial expression datasets are collected and preprocessed through face detection and normalization. The CNN architecture is then designed based on the characteristics of the preprocessed data, followed by model training on split datasets. Real-time optimization techniques are applied to enhance computational efficiency for deployment on resource-constrained devices. The model's performance is rigorously evaluated using various metrics and compared with existing models, ensuring advancements in FER technology. Ethical considerations, such as privacy and bias, are integrated throughout the project. The validated model is then ready for deployment, contributing to applications like human-computer interaction. This systematic flow ensures the development of an accurate and ethical FER system.
